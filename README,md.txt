## Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting the condition of a machine using machine learning. I have used a **Random Forest Classifier** to analyze input data such as temperature, vibration level, oil quality, RPM, and other mechanical parameters to determine whether a machine is functioning normally or has potential faults.

This type of predictive system can help in maintenance planning and early fault detection in mechanical systems.

## Required Libraries

Before running the code, make sure to install the required Python libraries. Use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

This will install everything needed to run the prediction script.

## Important Files for Prediction

These files are needed to make the prediction work correctly:

* `random_forest_model.pkl` – The trained machine learning model.
* `scaler.pkl` – Used to normalize input data the same way it was done during training.
* `selected_features.pkl` – A list of the features used in the training process, which ensures correct column ordering.

All these files must be in the same directory as your script.

## How the Prediction Process Works

1. **Loading the Tools**

   * Load the model with `joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')`.
   * Load the scaler with `joblib.load('scaler.pkl')`.
   * Load the list of selected features with `joblib.load('selected_features.pkl')`.

2. **Input Preparation**

   * Create a single-row `DataFrame` using pandas with values for all the required features.
   * Make sure the column names are exactly the same as those in the training data.

3. **Data Scaling**

   * Use the loaded scaler to transform the input data so that it matches the model’s expectations.

4. **Making a Prediction**

   * Use `.predict()` to get the final output class.
   * Use `.predict_proba()` to see the probability scores for each possible class.

## How to Use the Prediction Script

Here is a sample code you can use in a Python file (like `predict.py`):

```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load model, scaler, and selected features
model = joblib.load('random_forest_model.pkl')
scaler = joblib.load('scaler.pkl')
selected_features = joblib.load('selected_features.pkl')

# Example input data
new_data = pd.DataFrame([{
    'Temperature_C': 75,
    'Vibration_mm_s': 2.5,
    'Oil_Quality_Index': 88,
    'RPM': 1500,
    'Pressure_bar': 5.2,
    'Shaft_Misalignment_deg': 0.3,
    'Noise_dB': 70,
    'Load_%': 85,
    'Power_kW': 12.5
}])

# Arrange features in correct order
new_data = new_data[selected_features]

# Apply scaling
scaled_data = scaler.transform(new_data)

# Predict machine condition
prediction = model.predict(scaled_data)
prediction_proba = model.predict_proba(scaled_data)

print("Predicted Condition:", prediction[0])
print("Prediction Confidence:", prediction_proba[0])
```

## Things to Keep in Mind

* Your input must contain **all the same features** used in training.
* The values should be realistic and within the usual operating range.
* The order of features in the data matters — do not change the column sequence.

---

## Future Scope: Retraining the Model

If needed, the model can be retrained with new data. For that:

* Follow the same steps for preprocessing.
* Use consistent feature selection and scaling.
* Save the new model and tools using `joblib`.

---

## Practical Applications

* Predict whether a machine is operating **normally** or showing **faulty behavior**.
* Useful in industrial setups, maintenance departments, and smart monitoring systems using IoT.

This project helped me understand how machine learning can be applied to real mechanical systems to make smarter maintenance decisions.
